Since I'm not a backend developer, David told me to follow the front-end instructions, so I did. i felt free to use a free Api with random users name that is called when the page loads. That name is stored in a Redux store that i set up. I made an input field that allows the user to change the name stored on the redux store and it's rendered. Also i set a default user avatar pic that we can change using a pic of our pc.

this is pure Reac, so if you clone this you can run with node as "npm start"
